    <h3>AMBER Lab (2020â€”present)</h3>
    I'm working with Dr. Aaron Ames and Maegan Tucker (a grad student) to develop a robust ankle exoskeleton design. Here's a brief timeline of my work:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Summer 2020:</b> Mechanical/electrical design of powered, strut-based ankle exoskeleton (read more).</li>
        <li><b>Fall 2020:</b> Controls simulation for strut-based ankle exo.</li>
        <li><b>Current:</b> Development of passive, spring-based ankle exo.</li>
    </ul>
