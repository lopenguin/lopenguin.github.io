    I'm working with Dr. Aaron Ames and Maegan Tucker (a grad student) to develop a robust ankle exoskeleton design. Here's a brief timeline of my work:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Summer 2020:</b> Mechanical/electrical design of powered, strut-based ankle exoskeleton
            (<a href="

                    {% break %}
                {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}

        <li><b>Fall 2020:</b> Controls simulation for strut-based ankle exo.</li>
        <li><b>Winter 2021:</b> Development of passive, spring-based ankle exo.</li>
        <li><b>Spring 2021:</b> Evolution of passive ankle exo into variable-spring-actuated ankle exo.</li>
        <li><b>Current:</b> Controls work with IMUs, quaternions, and actuated ankle exo prototype.</li>
