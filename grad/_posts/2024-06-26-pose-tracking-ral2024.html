title: Certifiable Category-Level Tracking
description: My first publication with SPARK Lab considers the problem of simultaneously estimating an object's shape and tracking its pose. We propose a certifiably optimal method built on the convex relaxation of a fixed lag smoother. We show the method largely outperforms others on simulated data, the YCBInEOAT manipulation dataset, and a custom drone vehicle tracking scenario.<br><br>Read our paper on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16837'>arXiv</a> and view our code on <a href='https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/certifiable_tracking'>github</a>.
