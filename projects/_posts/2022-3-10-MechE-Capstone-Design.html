title: MechE Capstone Design
description: I was part of a team of seven that competed in the <a href="https://mce.caltech.edu/events/me72">37th Annual ME 72 Competition</a> for our capstone design. The competition was about building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS-L2fpV1Is">sumo robots</a>--together we built one wheeled robot capable of R/C and autonomous sumo flight and one "strand bot" that used a planar linkage inspired by Theo Jansen's <a href="https://www.strandbeest.com/">Strandbeests</a>. I focused on the latter bot, which is shown in battle left.
