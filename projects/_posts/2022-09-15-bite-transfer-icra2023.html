title: Robotic In-Mouth Bite Transfer
description: Over summer 2022 I worked in <a href='https://dorsa.fyi/'>Prof. Dorsa Sadigh's lab</a> at Stanford on robotic bite transfer. During the fellowship I designed and 3D printed a compact two degree-of-freedom wrist mount and used it to make robotic assistive feeding more comfortable. My focus was bringing bite-sized food directly into the mouth.<br><br>Read our paper on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12705'>arXiv</a> or <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10160467'>IEEE</a>.
