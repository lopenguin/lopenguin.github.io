title: Interactive Piano Playing Robot
description: "For ME 134 (Robot Systems) my team built a piano playing robot. We designed a 9 degree of freedom robot with two end effectors capable of playing up to two notes at a time. The emphasis was interactivity: our robot followed the piano if someone moved it around, even pulling it back into a playable region if necessary. It could teach the user to play a song, halt playing when someone got too close, and celebrate with claps and dances when it finished."
