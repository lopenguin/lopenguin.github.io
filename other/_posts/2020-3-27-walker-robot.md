Back at the start of COVID quarantine, I wanted to try making a simple walking robot. The design I settled on (above) has two legs directly driven by a basic geared motor. Suffice it to say, the design as you see here didn't work very well. I ended up adding a third stabilizing leg, but even after that it only sorta worked. I've got some video of that and the interesting testing apparatuses I came up with that I won't include here. Let me know if you'd like to see it though!

Besides being a fun little project to pass the time, this did teach me a fair bit about driving motors. I ended up using a L293D H-bridge to drive the motors with a 5V battery. The L293D has become my go-to chip for driving motors, but the 5V battery only gave me very low speeds and torques.
