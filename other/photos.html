            My team's planetary gearbox for ME 14! This front view shows the two planet gears connected to the spider gear and mated with a center sun gear and outer ring gear. I worked mostly on the alignment of the ring gear and the arrangement of the planets.

            A view of the gearbox in the competition setup. Several problems quickly emerged in testing. The large clamps are there because our holes for screwing the transmission to the table were misaligned. Additionally, the weight of the spider gear and its distant support introduced a lot of vibration into the system.
