I"ï<p>Back at the start of COVID quarantine, I wanted to try making a simple walking robot. The design I settled on (above) has two legs directly driven by a basic geared motor. Suffice it to say, the design as you see here didnâ€™t work very well. I ended up adding a third stabilizing leg, but even after that it only sorta worked. Iâ€™ve got some video of that and the interesting testing apparatuses I came up with that I wonâ€™t include here. Let me know if youâ€™d like to see it though!</p>
