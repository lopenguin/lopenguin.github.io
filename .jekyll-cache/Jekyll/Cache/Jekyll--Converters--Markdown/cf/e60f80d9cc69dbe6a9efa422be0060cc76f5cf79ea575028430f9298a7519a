I"¨<p>Back at the start of COVID quarantine, I wanted to try making a simple walking robot. The design I settled on (above) has two legs directly driven by a basic geared motor. Suffice it to say, the design as you see here didnâ€™t work very well. I ended up adding a third stabilizing leg, but even after that it only sorta worked. Iâ€™ve got some video of that and the interesting testing apparatuses I came up with that I wonâ€™t include here. Let me know if youâ€™d like to see it though!</p>

<p>Besides being a fun little project to pass the time, this did teach me a fair bit about driving motors. I ended up using a L293D H-bridge to drive the motors with a 5V battery.</p>
