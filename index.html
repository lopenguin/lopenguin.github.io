        Hello! I'm Lorenzo Shaikewitz, a Caltech student studying mechanical engineering. I built this site to keep track of my research and personal projects through college. It contains:
        <ul>
            <li>Information about some of my recent research</li>
            <li>Pictures, thoughts, and technical information related to various projects I'm working on</li>
            <li>Other, random things I thought deserved a spot on a website</li>
        </ul>
        Feel free to reach out to me by email: lorenzo AT caltech.edu
        <!-- Other: featured image + link, then link to subpages. Maybe include a "failures" subpage -->
